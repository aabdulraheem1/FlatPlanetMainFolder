# WIP DOUBLE DEDUCTION FIX IMPLEMENTED

## Issue Summary:
WIP inventory was being deducted twice in the quantity flow:
1. **First deduction**: In replenishment calculation when delivery location ≠ production site
2. **Second deduction**: In production calculation at production site
3. **Result**: Production quantities were artificially low

## Solution Implemented: Option 2 - Simplify Replenishment Logic

### Changes Made to `populate_calculated_replenishment_v2.py`:

1. **Removed Complex Inventory Logic** (Lines 460-490):
   - Eliminated conditional inventory checking based on delivery location vs production site
   - Removed WIP deduction at replenishment stage
   - Simplified to always use full gross demand

2. **New Logic**:
   ```python
   # Always use full gross demand - no inventory deduction at replenishment stage
   net_requirement = float(gross_demand)
   ```

3. **Updated Logging**:
   - Changed summary messages to reflect no inventory deductions
   - Added confirmation that WIP double deduction is resolved
   - Removed unused counters for inventory reductions

### Benefits:

✅ **Eliminates WIP Double Deduction**: WIP is now only deducted once (in production)  
✅ **Simpler Logic**: No complex conditional logic based on site relationships  
✅ **Production Quantities Fixed**: Will now show realistic production requirements  
✅ **Maintains Functionality**: Production command already handles all inventory correctly  
✅ **No Data Loss**: All inventory (OnHand, InTransit, WIP) is still properly utilized  

### How It Works Now:

1. **Replenishment Stage**: Creates replenishment records for full forecast demand
2. **Production Stage**: Deducts all available inventory (OnHand + InTransit + WIP) from replenishment to calculate actual production needed
3. **Result**: Correct production quantities that reflect true manufacturing requirements

### Testing Recommendation:

After this fix, you should see:
- **Higher production quantities** (more realistic)
- **Proper inventory utilization** (WIP counted only once)
- **Accurate capacity planning** 
- **Better financial projections**

Run the replenishment and production calculations again to see the corrected quantities.

### Status: 
✅ **IMPLEMENTED AND READY FOR TESTING**
