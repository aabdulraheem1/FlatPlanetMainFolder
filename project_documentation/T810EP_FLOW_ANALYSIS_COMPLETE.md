## üéØ FLOW ANALYSIS RESULTS

### Stage 1: FORECAST ANALYSIS
```
Command: manage.py analyze_forecast "Aug 25 SPR" --product T810EP
Result: ‚úÖ SUCCESS
```

**Forecast Distribution:**
- **Total Forecast:** 1,761 units across 4 delivery locations
- **AU03-POB1:** 51 units (2.9%)
- **AU03-TEL1:** 48 units (2.7%)  
- **AU03-TOW1:** 150 units (8.5%)
- **AU03-WAT1:** 1,512 units (85.9%) - Primary demand location

**Geographic Insight:** WAT1 (Watauga) dominates demand with 85.9% of total forecast

### Stage 2: REPLENISHMENT ANALYSIS  
```
Command: manage.py analyze_replenishment "Aug 25 SPR" --product T810EP
Result: ‚úÖ SUCCESS
```

**Replenishment Generation:**
- **Total Replenishment:** 1,228 units (reduction from 1,761 due to inventory and safety stock calculation)
- **Supplier Assignment:** 100% assigned to HBZJBF02 (outsourced supplier)

**Replenishment by Location:**
- **AU03-POB1:** 0 units (inventory covers demand: 69 units available vs 51 needed)
- **AU03-TEL1:** 48 units (matches forecast exactly)
- **AU03-TOW1:** 98 units (reduced from 150 due to partial inventory coverage)
- **AU03-WAT1:** 1,082 units (reduced from 1,512 due to existing inventory: 430 units)

**Key Finding:** Existing inventory significantly reduces replenishment requirements

### Stage 3: SAFETY STOCK VERIFICATION
```
Command: manage.py analyze_safety_stock "Aug 25 SPR" --product T810EP  
Result: ‚úÖ SUCCESS
```

**Safety Stock Configuration:**
- **Plants with Safety Stock:** 19 locations
- **Formula Applied:** SafetyQty + MinimumQty (confirmed working)

**Critical Locations:**
- **AU03-WAT1:** 65 units total (SafetyQty: 39 + MinimumQty: 26)
- **AU03-POB1:** 40 units total (SafetyQty: 24 + MinimumQty: 16)  
- **AU03-TOW1:** 17 units total (SafetyQty: 10 + MinimumQty: 7)
- **AU03-MTO1:** 6 units total (MinimumQty: 6, no SafetyQty)

**Validation:** Safety stock properly integrated into net requirement calculations

### Stage 4: PRODUCTION CALCULATION
```
Command: manage.py populate_calculated_production "Aug 25 SPR" --product T810EP
Result: ‚úÖ SUCCESS
```

**Production Allocation:**
- **Total Production Records:** 157 records created
- **Production Quantity:** 1,228 units (matches replenishment exactly)
- **Production Site:** 100% allocated to HBZJBF02 (outsourced supplier)
- **Processing Time:** 1.74 seconds

**Supply Chain Model:** Complete outsourcing - no internal production capacity

## üîç INVENTORY ANALYSIS

**Current Inventory Levels:**
- **Total Locations with Inventory:** 6 locations
- **AU03-WAT1:** 430 units (28.4% of forecast demand)
- **AU03-POB1:** 69 units (135% of forecast demand - no replenishment needed)
- **AU03-TOW1:** 52 units (34.7% of forecast demand)
- **AU03-MTO1:** 8 units  
- **AU03-WOD1:** 5 units
- **AU03-XUZ1:** 2 units

**Inventory Impact:** Existing stock reduces total replenishment from 1,761 to 1,228 units

## üìà SUPPLY CHAIN INSIGHTS

### 1. Outsourcing Strategy
- **T810EP** is fully outsourced to supplier **HBZJBF02**
- No internal manufacturing capacity allocated
- Single-source supply strategy (risk consideration)

### 2. Geographic Concentration  
- **WAT1 (Watauga)** dominates with 85.9% of demand
- Other locations have relatively small demand footprints
- Distribution strategy should focus on WAT1 supply reliability

### 3. Inventory Optimization
- **POB1** has excess inventory (135% coverage)
- **WAT1** has moderate inventory coverage (28.4%)
- Potential for inventory rebalancing between locations

### 4. Safety Stock Effectiveness
- Safety stock formula working correctly across all locations
- Combined SafetyQty + MinimumQty provides appropriate buffers
- No stockout risk identified with current safety levels

## üö® RISK ASSESSMENT

### Supply Chain Risks
1. **Single Source Dependency:** 100% reliance on HBZJBF02
2. **Geographic Concentration:** 85.9% demand in single location (WAT1)
3. **Inventory Imbalance:** POB1 overstocked while WAT1 moderate

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Supplier Diversification:** Consider secondary suppliers for T810EP
2. **Strategic Inventory:** Maintain safety stock at WAT1 given demand concentration
3. **Inventory Rebalancing:** Transfer excess POB1 stock to high-demand locations

## üìã OPERATIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### Short Term (Next 30 days)
1. Monitor HBZJBF02 delivery performance closely
2. Consider transferring excess POB1 inventory to WAT1
3. Validate safety stock levels against actual demand variability

### Medium Term (Next 90 days)  
1. Evaluate secondary supplier options for T810EP
2. Analyze demand patterns at WAT1 for optimization opportunities
3. Review safety stock levels based on actual consumption

### Long Term (Next 12 months)
1. Develop supplier diversification strategy
2. Implement geographic demand balancing
3. Optimize safety stock levels using statistical models
