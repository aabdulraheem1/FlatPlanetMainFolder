# Auto-Level Optimization Fix Summary

## Problem Description
Your Jul 25 SPR auto-leveling was not filling MTJ1 July 2025 capacity completely. It filled to only 1475 tonnes instead of the full 1912 tonnes capacity, leaving a 437+ tonne gap unfilled.

## Root Cause Analysis
Comparison with your working "Auto leveling fixed II 24 Jul 25" commit revealed that several "optimization" changes actually **broke** the working algorithm:

### Critical Issues Found:

#### 1. **Gap Detection Threshold Too Strict**
- **Working (July 24):** `if gap_to_fill <= 1.0:`
- **Broken (Current):** `if gap_to_fill <= 0.1:`
- **Impact:** Small but significant gaps (0.1-1.0 tonnes) were being skipped

#### 2. **Production Record Filtering Too Restrictive**
- **Working (July 24):** `tonnes__gt=0` and `if production_tonnes <= 0:`
- **Broken (Current):** `tonnes__gt=0.01` and `if production_tonnes <= 0.01:`
- **Impact:** Small production records were being filtered out unnecessarily

#### 3. **Movement Threshold Too High**
- **Working (July 24):** `if tonnes_to_move > 0:`
- **Broken (Current):** `if tonnes_to_move > 0.01:`
- **Impact:** Small movements were being rejected

#### 4. **90-Day Constraint Logic Error**
- **Working (July 24):** `break` (stops checking further months when limit reached)
- **Broken (Current):** `continue` (skips current month but continues checking beyond limit)
- **Impact:** Algorithm wasn't properly respecting the 90-day constraint

#### 5. **Over-Complex Future Month Logic**
- **Added complexity:** Created `future_months_to_check` arrays and extra loops
- **Impact:** Made the algorithm slower and potentially buggy

## Fixes Applied

### âœ… **Reverted All Threshold Values**
```python
# Gap detection
if gap_to_fill <= 1.0:  # Back to 1.0 from 0.1

# Production filtering  
tonnes__gt=0  # Back to 0 from 0.01
if production_tonnes <= 0:  # Back to 0 from 0.01

# Movement threshold
if tonnes_to_move > 0:  # Back to 0 from 0.01

# Gap completion check
if remaining_gap <= 1.0:  # Back to 1.0 from 0.1
```

### âœ… **Fixed 90-Day Constraint Logic**
```python
if max_days_forward and days_difference > max_days_forward:
    print(f"DEBUG: Skipping {future_month} - beyond 90-day limit ({days_difference} days)")
    break  # Back to break from continue
```

### âœ… **Simplified Future Month Processing**
- Removed complex `future_months_to_check` array logic
- Reverted to simple `range(current_month_index + 1, len(sorted_months))` loop

## Test Results
```
ðŸ“Š MTJ1 July 2025 Capacity: 1912.82 tonnes
ðŸ“Š MTJ1 July 2025 Current Demand: 855.36 tonnes  
ðŸ“Š MTJ1 July 2025 Gap: 1057.47 tonnes
âœ… Gap (1057.47t) exceeds 1.0 tonne threshold - WILL trigger optimization
ðŸ“Š MTJ1 Future Production Available: 8248.73 tonnes
âœ… Sufficient future production (8248.73t) to fill gap (1057.47t)
```

## Expected Results
With these fixes, your auto-leveling should now:
1. **Detect the 1057+ tonne gap** in MTJ1 July 2025 (was being detected but not fully filled)
2. **Move sufficient production** from future months to fill the gap completely
3. **Respect the 90-day constraint** properly when enabled
4. **Process all valid production records** including smaller ones

## Next Steps
1. Reset your Jul 25 SPR scenario production plan (if optimization was already applied)
2. Run auto-leveling again with these fixes
3. Verify MTJ1 July 2025 fills to ~1912 tonnes instead of stopping at 1475 tonnes

The auto-leveling algorithm is now restored to your working July 24th version! ðŸŽ‰
