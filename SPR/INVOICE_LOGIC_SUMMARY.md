# Enhanced Invoice Logic Summary

## What the Enhanced Logic Does:

### 1. PowerBI Invoice Processing (REPEAT products)
- Products found in PowerBI invoices get:
  - `product_type = 'repeat'` 
  - `latest_invoice_date = actual_invoice_date` (from PowerBI)
  - `latest_customer_name = customer_name` (from PowerBI)

### 2. SMART Forecast Fallback (NEW products)
- Products NOT in PowerBI but found in SMART forecasts get:
  - `product_type = 'new'`
  - `latest_invoice_date = None` (blank - never been invoiced)
  - `latest_customer_name = customer_name` (from forecast lookup)

### 3. Unknown Products (TRULY NEW) âœ… **UPDATED**
- Products NOT found in either source get:
  - `product_type = 'new'` (marked as new via cleanup)
  - `latest_invoice_date = None` (blank)  
  - `latest_customer_name = None` (blank)

### 4. **NEW: CLEANUP STEP** ðŸ§¹
This is the enhancement you requested - ensures data consistency:

**Finds and fixes products with inconsistent data:**
- Products marked as `'repeat'` but with no invoice date
- Products with blank customer names but non-blank invoice dates
- **NEW:** Products not found anywhere (completely blank) â†’ marked as `'new'`

**Cleanup action:**
- Sets `latest_invoice_date = None` (blank)
- Sets `product_type = 'new'` (never invoiced OR not found anywhere)
- Updates `customer_data_last_updated = now()`

## Key Rules:
âœ… **No invoice date = NEW product (not repeat)**
âœ… **Invoice date exists = REPEAT product** 
âœ… **Cleanup ensures consistency between invoice_date and product_type**

## Example Scenarios:
- Product BK12345 has PowerBI invoice from 2024-07-15 â†’ `product_type='repeat'`, `invoice_date='2024-07-15'`
- Product BK67890 only in SMART forecast â†’ `product_type='new'`, `invoice_date=None`
- Product BK11111 nowhere to be found â†’ `product_type='new'` (via cleanup), `invoice_date=None`
- **CLEANUP:** Product incorrectly marked as 'repeat' but no invoice â†’ Fixed to `product_type='new'`, `invoice_date=None`
