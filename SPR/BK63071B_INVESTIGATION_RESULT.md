- Invoiced to customer `Swakop Uranium Pty Ltd`
- This means the product has been sold/invoiced before, making it a "repeat" product

## Logic Validation
The enhanced invoice logic is working correctly:

1. **Step 1 - PowerBI Invoice Check**: ✅ PASSED
   - BK63071B was found in PowerBI invoice data
   - Assigned `product_type = 'repeat'`
   - Set `latest_invoice_date = 2025-08-17`
   - Set `latest_customer_name = 'Swakop Uranium Pty Ltd'`

2. **Step 2 - SMART Fallback**: ⏭️ SKIPPED
   - Not needed since PowerBI found invoice data

3. **Step 3 - Cleanup Logic**: ⏭️ NOT NEEDED
   - Product has consistent data (has invoice date AND marked as repeat)

## Conclusion
**BK63071B is correctly classified as "repeat"** because:
- It has been invoiced before (2025-08-17)
- It has a known customer (Swakop Uranium Pty Ltd)
- The invoice logic is working as designed

If you expected it to be "new", please verify:
- Whether this invoice date is correct in the PowerBI system
- Whether this product should indeed be considered "new" despite having invoice history
- Whether there's a specific business rule about what constitutes "new" vs "repeat" products

✅ Invoice logic is working correctly
✅ Product categorization is accurate
✅ Customer data is properly populated
