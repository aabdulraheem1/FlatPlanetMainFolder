## ✅ **UPDATED INVOICE LOGIC - COMPLETE SUMMARY**

### **Enhanced Logic Flow:**

```
📊 STEP 1: PowerBI Invoice Processing
   ├── Found in PowerBI invoices? 
   ├── ✅ YES → product_type='repeat' + actual invoice date + customer name
   └── ❌ NO → Continue to Step 2

📈 STEP 2: SMART Forecast Fallback  
   ├── Found in SMART forecasts?
   ├── ✅ YES → product_type='new' + invoice_date=None + customer from forecast
   └── ❌ NO → Continue to Step 3

🧹 STEP 3: CLEANUP (Enhanced)
   ├── Check for inconsistent data:
   ├── - Products marked 'repeat' but no invoice date
   ├── - Products with blank customer but non-blank invoice  
   ├── - Products not found anywhere (completely blank)
   └── ✅ FIX ALL → product_type='new' + invoice_date=None
```

### **Final Product States:**

| **Scenario** | **product_type** | **latest_invoice_date** | **latest_customer_name** | **Meaning** |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| **PowerBI Invoice** | `'repeat'` | ✅ Actual date | ✅ From PowerBI | Previously invoiced |
| **SMART Forecast** | `'new'` | ❌ None (blank) | ✅ From forecast | Never invoiced but has customer |
| **Not Found Anywhere** | `'new'` | ❌ None (blank) | ❌ None (blank) | Never invoiced, no data |
| **Inconsistent Data** | `'new'` | ❌ None (blank) | varies | Fixed by cleanup |

### **Key Guarantees:**
✅ **No invoice date = NEW product (never 'repeat')**  
✅ **Invoice date exists = REPEAT product**  
✅ **All products without invoices marked as 'new'**  
✅ **No orphaned or inconsistent data states**

### **What Changed:**
- ✅ Products "not found anywhere" now get `product_type='new'` (instead of staying blank)
- ✅ Enhanced cleanup catches more edge cases
- ✅ Consistent logic: never invoiced = always marked as 'new'
