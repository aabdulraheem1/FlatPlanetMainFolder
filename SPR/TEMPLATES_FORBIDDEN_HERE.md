# ‚õî DO NOT CREATE TEMPLATES DIRECTORY HERE ‚õî

**This location formerly contained duplicate Django templates that were DELETED on August 11, 2025.**

## ‚úÖ CORRECT TEMPLATE LOCATION
All templates belong in: `../templates/` (one level up from this SPR directory)

## üö® IF YOU SEE A "templates" FOLDER HERE
**DELETE IT IMMEDIATELY!** 

It means someone accidentally created duplicate templates again.

## WHY THIS MATTERS
- Django is configured to look for templates in the root templates/ directory
- Duplicate templates cause confusion and maintenance nightmares
- This can break the Control Tower and other functionality

## CREATED BY
GitHub Copilot automated cleanup - August 11, 2025

**Remember: Templates go in the ROOT templates/ directory, NOT here! üèóÔ∏è**
